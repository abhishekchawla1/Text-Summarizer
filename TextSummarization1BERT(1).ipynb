Which of these offers the highest performance for listing files matching a specific wildcard in a medium-sized bucket (half a billion files) in the US multiregion when accessed from both the US and Western Europe?\\nUnsurprisingly, the GCLOUD CLI is the slowest, with the Python library offering 2-4x speedup. Using CURL to access the GCS JSON API directly yields blazingly fast performance, with European VM accesses that are 8.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.6x faster than Python and US VM accesses that are 16.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.3x faster than Python. From a US-WEST1 VM, we can perform a listing operation on a folder prefix containing 10 million files in a bucket containing half a billion files and return the 150 matching results in around 0.072 seconds, while a EUROPE-WEST2 VM takes just 0.016 seconds \\u2013 making it almost fast enough to operate as a primitive queuing system.\\nFor the purposes of this brief experiment, we'll use bucket that contains around half a billion files and a \\\"folder\\\" prefix under that bucket that contains around 10 million files. We will just perform a file listing asking for all files matching a specific wildcard.\\nFirst, let's test GCLOUD STORAGE. The old \\\"gsutil\\\" utility is officially depreciated and gloud storage offers performance gains over gsutil. We'll report the median of 50 sequential runs from a 64-core N1 VM in US-WEST1 (Oregon) and EUROPE-WEST2 (London) against a bucket with 500 million files in the US-MULTI region. In this case, \\\"gs://bucket/folder/\\\" contains roughly 10 million files and our specific wildcard below matches 150 files. Here we can see that despite nearly half a billion files in the bucket, our listing returns in around 1.2-1.3 seconds. Notably, there is only a slight difference in timing between the two VMs:\\ntime gcloud storage ls gs://bucket/folder/ABC*.zip | wc -l\\n#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m1.314s\\n#US-WEST1: 0m1.169s\\nWhile sufficient for many tasks, this isn't performant enough for many applications. Let's try GCP's native Python library. Note that GCLOUD is actually written in Python, but here we'll test how GCS integration performs in an end user application that is much simpler and more streamlined.\\nFirst we'll install the library:\\npip install google-cloud-storage\\nSave the following as \\\"gcstest.py\\\":\\nfrom google.cloud import storage\\nimport fnmatch\\n\\ndef list_blobs_with_prefix(bucket_name, prefix, delimiter=None):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Lists all the blobs in the bucket that begin with the prefix.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    storage_client = storage.Client()\\n    blobs = storage_client.list_blobs(bucket_name, prefix=prefix, delimiter=delimiter)\\n\\n    return [blob.name for blob in blobs if fnmatch.fnmatch(blob.name, \\\"*.zip\\\")]\\n\\n# Replace 'my-bucket' with your bucket name and 'my-path/' with your path\\nbucket_name = 'bucket'\\nprefix = 'bucket/folder/ABC'\\n\\nmatching_files = list_blobs_with_prefix(bucket_name, prefix)\\nprint(\\\"Files matching the pattern:\\\", matching_files)\\nNow we'll run the script. Note that the library must first obtain an access token before performing the ls and includes the substantial startup cost of the full Python interpreter. In a production application, these would be partially ameliorated by the script performing these at startup. However, a long running script would still require token refresh and in this case we are testing the full cold start performance, replicating a cronjob or other process. Here the performance is nearly twice as fast as gcloud on the European VM and almost 4 times as fast on the US VM. Clearly using the native Python library is considerably faster and even applications that must wrap a workflow in a CLI utility (such as supporting a COTS application) will be better served performance-wise by writing their own Python script to perform key tasks than using gcloud:\\ntime python3 ./gcstest.py\\n#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m0.739s\\n#US-WEST1: 0m0.313s\\nFinally, what about the native GCS JSON API? Presumably this should offer the fastest performance, since this has the lowest possible overhead. As a bonus, when running on a GCE VM, we have instant access to the access token for authentication. For even greater speedup, we'll use the \\\"fields\\\" parameter to ask the API to return only the filenames, not the full JSON record for each file \\u2013 this yields considerable performance gains. As expected, this yields the best performance by a considerable margin. European accesses are 8.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.6x faster than Python, while US accesses are 16.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.3x faster than Python. Note that the API returns a maximum of 1,000 results by default (this can be increased using maxResults, but is not fully respected by the API) and can return fewer, requiring parsing the pagination token and making subsequent results to ingest all results, so this is a simplified workflow that is designed for use cases where there are only a few matching results.\\ntime curl -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $(curl -s \\\"http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token\\\" -H \\\"Metadata-Flavor: Google\\\" | jq -r '.access_token')\\\" \\\\\\n  \\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/bucket/o?prefix=folder/ABC&fields=items(name)&matchGlob=folder/ABC*zip\\\"\\n#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m0.160s\\n#US-WEST1: 0m0.072s\\n \\nThe Official GDELT Project Blog\\n\",\n          \"\\nIf you're at Google I/O 2024 next week in Mountain View, make sure to say hello!\\nThe Official GDELT Project Blog\\n\",\n          \"\\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of generative AI models including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is the immense speed and continuous manner in which they and their underlying guardrails, tuning and nudging are updated. A prompt that works flawlessly can suddenly cease to yield useable results an hour later, while a prompt that yields hopeless fabrication and hallucination can suddenly start working nearly perfectly days later.\\nJust 48 hours ago on December 31st we conducted a series of experiments testing how GCP's new Gemini Pro Vision multimodal model analyzes a variety of images. Yet, retrying several of those examples today, just 48 hours after the original experiments were run, yields a surprising finding: two of the most severely hallucinated examples, both of which yielded near-total fabrications of the image contents, now yield nearly flawless results, while the other examples yield the same results, including the same hallucinations and fabrications for those image prompts that performed poorly last time.\\nThe findings here both reflect the nearly unimaginable speed at which generative AI models are being updated and the replicability dangers that may lead to false confidence in organizational deployments. It is truly remarkable that two prompts that just 48 hours ago exclusively yielded fabrications from whole cloth today return nearly flawless results. At the same time, this speed of development offers a cautionary warning for organizations deployment generative AI systems. Prompts that yield incorrect results may suddenly begin working before they are reviewed by downstream trust and risk teams. In some cases, benchmark datasets of problematic prompts are likely to improve dramatically as those benchmarks are used by vendors to tune their models yielding substantial improvements that are narrowly applied only to that benchmark, leading to false confidence in overall performance. In the case of the examples here, imagine an organization that attempts to replicate only the first two examples and finds that the fabrications observed for those two prompts on December 31st have now been replaced with accurate results. They might reasonable assume the remaining hallucinated prompts have similarly been corrected and not spend the effort verifying the complete list of prompts. Worse, they might assume that the entire underlying process such as OCR or image description has been corrected without examining further whether the corrections applied only narrowly to this specific image.\\nLet's start with our Putin image:\\n\\nLet's try this basic prompt that 48 hours ago yielded incorrect results about two men speaking to one another and a yellow star in the background:\\nTell me about this image.\\nThis time it yields accurate results:\\nHow about a longer-form prompt that 48 hours ago consistently yielded complete fabrications of a North Korean military parade?\\nWrite 3 paragraphs of text describing this image in detail, specifying precisely what it depicts and any underlying symbolism.\\nOnce again, this time we get an accurate description. Running multiple times all yields results identical to the below:\\nThe image shows Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking at a meeting of the Supervisory Board of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities. The meeting took place in Moscow and was broadcast on the Russia-24 TV channel.\\nPutin is sitting in a large, ornate chair with a red background. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie. The Russian flag is visible behind him. Putin is speaking passionately, and his gestures are animated. He is likely discussing the work of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities, which is a non-profit organization that provides educational and training opportunities for young people.\\nThe image is significant because it shows Putin engaged in a domestic policy meeting. This suggests that he is focused on the internal affairs of Russia, rather than on foreign policy. The meeting is also taking place in Moscow, which is the capital of Russia. This suggests that the decisions made at the meeting will have a significant impact on the country.\\nEven increasing temperature from its default 0.4 to 1.0 still yields the correct results, rather than the fabrication of 48 hours ago:\\nThe image shows Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking at a meeting of the Supervisory Board of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities. The meeting took place in Moscow and was broadcast on the Russia-24 TV channel.\\nPutin is sitting in a chair at the head of a long table, with a Russian flag and a flag of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities behind him. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie, and he is speaking into a microphone.

Which of these offers the highest performance for listing files matching a specific wildcard in a medium-sized bucket (half a billion files) in the US multiregion when accessed from both the US and Western Europe?Unsurprisingly, the GCLOUD CLI is the slowest, with the Python library offering 2-4x speedup. Using CURL to access the GCS JSON API directly yields blazingly fast performance, with European VM accesses that are 8.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.6x faster than Python and US VM accesses that are 16.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.3x faster than Python. From a US-WEST1 VM, we can perform a listing operation on a folder prefix containing 10 million files in a bucket containing half a billion files and return the 150 matching results in around 0.072 seconds, while a EUROPE-WEST2 VM takes just 0.016 seconds \\u2013 making it almost fast enough to operate as a primitive queuing system.For the purposes of this brief experiment, we'll use bucket that contains around half a billion files and a \\\"folder\\\" prefix under that bucket that contains around 10 million files. We will just perform a file listing asking for all files matching a specific wildcard.First, let's test GCLOUD STORAGE. The old \\\"gsutil\\\" utility is officially depreciated and gloud storage offers performance gains over gsutil. We'll report the median of 50 sequential runs from a 64-core N1 VM in US-WEST1 (Oregon) and EUROPE-WEST2 (London) against a bucket with 500 million files in the US-MULTI region. In this case, \\\"gs://bucket/folder/\\\" contains roughly 10 million files and our specific wildcard below matches 150 files. Here we can see that despite nearly half a billion files in the bucket, our listing returns in around 1.2-1.3 seconds. Notably, there is only a slight difference in timing between the two VMs:time gcloud storage ls gs://bucket/folder/ABC*.zip | wc -l#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m1.314s#US-WEST1: 0m1.169sWhile sufficient for many tasks, this isn't performant enough for many applications. Let's try GCP's native Python library. Note that GCLOUD is actually written in Python, but here we'll test how GCS integration performs in an end user application that is much simpler and more streamlined.First we'll install the library:pip install google-cloud-storageSave the following as \\\"gcstest.py\\\":from google.cloud import storageimport fnmatchdef list_blobs_with_prefix(bucket_name, prefix, delimiter=None):    \\\"\\\"\\\"Lists all the blobs in the bucket that begin with the prefix.\\\"\\\"\\\"    storage_client = storage.Client()    blobs = storage_client.list_blobs(bucket_name, prefix=prefix, delimiter=delimiter)    return [blob.name for blob in blobs if fnmatch.fnmatch(blob.name, \\\"*.zip\\\")]# Replace 'my-bucket' with your bucket name and 'my-path/' with your pathbucket_name = 'bucket'prefix = 'bucket/folder/ABC'matching_files = list_blobs_with_prefix(bucket_name, prefix)print(\\\"Files matching the pattern:\\\", matching_files)Now we'll run the script. Note that the library must first obtain an access token before performing the ls and includes the substantial startup cost of the full Python interpreter. In a production application, these would be partially ameliorated by the script performing these at startup. However, a long running script would still require token refresh and in this case we are testing the full cold start performance, replicating a cronjob or other process. Here the performance is nearly twice as fast as gcloud on the European VM and almost 4 times as fast on the US VM. Clearly using the native Python library is considerably faster and even applications that must wrap a workflow in a CLI utility (such as supporting a COTS application) will be better served performance-wise by writing their own Python script to perform key tasks than using gcloud:time python3 ./gcstest.py#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m0.739s#US-WEST1: 0m0.313sFinally, what about the native GCS JSON API? Presumably this should offer the fastest performance, since this has the lowest possible overhead. As a bonus, when running on a GCE VM, we have instant access to the access token for authentication. For even greater speedup, we'll use the \\\"fields\\\" parameter to ask the API to return only the filenames, not the full JSON record for each file \\u2013 this yields considerable performance gains. As expected, this yields the best performance by a considerable margin. European accesses are 8.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.6x faster than Python, while US accesses are 16.2x faster than GCLOUD and 4.3x faster than Python. Note that the API returns a maximum of 1,000 results by default (this can be increased using maxResults, but is not fully respected by the API) and can return fewer, requiring parsing the pagination token and making subsequent results to ingest all results, so this is a simplified workflow that is designed for use cases where there are only a few matching results.time curl -X GET \\\\  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $(curl -s \\\"http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token\\\" -H \\\"Metadata-Flavor: Google\\\" | jq -r '.access_token')\\\" \\\\  \\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/bucket/o?prefix=folder/ABC&fields=items(name)&matchGlob=folder/ABC*zip\\\"#EUROPE-WEST2: 0m0.160s#US-WEST1: 0m0.072s The Official GDELT Project Blog\",\n          \"If you're at Google I/O 2024 next week in Mountain View, make sure to say hello!The Official GDELT Project Blog\",\n          \"One of the most remarkable aspects of generative AI models including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is the immense speed and continuous manner in which they and their underlying guardrails, tuning and nudging are updated. A prompt that works flawlessly can suddenly cease to yield useable results an hour later, while a prompt that yields hopeless fabrication and hallucination can suddenly start working nearly perfectly days later.Just 48 hours ago on December 31st we conducted a series of experiments testing how GCP's new Gemini Pro Vision multimodal model analyzes a variety of images. Yet, retrying several of those examples today, just 48 hours after the original experiments were run, yields a surprising finding: two of the most severely hallucinated examples, both of which yielded near-total fabrications of the image contents, now yield nearly flawless results, while the other examples yield the same results, including the same hallucinations and fabrications for those image prompts that performed poorly last time.The findings here both reflect the nearly unimaginable speed at which generative AI models are being updated and the replicability dangers that may lead to false confidence in organizational deployments. It is truly remarkable that two prompts that just 48 hours ago exclusively yielded fabrications from whole cloth today return nearly flawless results. At the same time, this speed of development offers a cautionary warning for organizations deployment generative AI systems. Prompts that yield incorrect results may suddenly begin working before they are reviewed by downstream trust and risk teams. In some cases, benchmark datasets of problematic prompts are likely to improve dramatically as those benchmarks are used by vendors to tune their models yielding substantial improvements that are narrowly applied only to that benchmark, leading to false confidence in overall performance. In the case of the examples here, imagine an organization that attempts to replicate only the first two examples and finds that the fabrications observed for those two prompts on December 31st have now been replaced with accurate results. They might reasonable assume the remaining hallucinated prompts have similarly been corrected and not spend the effort verifying the complete list of prompts. Worse, they might assume that the entire underlying process such as OCR or image description has been corrected without examining further whether the corrections applied only narrowly to this specific image.Let's start with our Putin image:Let's try this basic prompt that 48 hours ago yielded incorrect results about two men speaking to one another and a yellow star in the background:Tell me about this image.This time it yields accurate results:How about a longer-form prompt that 48 hours ago consistently yielded complete fabrications of a North Korean military parade?Write 3 paragraphs of text describing this image in detail, specifying precisely what it depicts and any underlying symbolism.Once again, this time we get an accurate description. Running multiple times all yields results identical to the below:The image shows Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking at a meeting of the Supervisory Board of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities.

The Russian flag is visible behind him. Putin is speaking passionately, and his gestures are animated. He is likely discussing the work of the ANO Russia \\u2013 Land of Opportunities, which is a non-profit organization that provides educational and training opportunities for young people.The image is significant because it shows Putin engaged in a domestic policy meeting.

We'll also be demonstrating some new approaches we're using internally to expand the effective reasoning window of foundation models to scales beyond anything available today through new representative architectures that will transform the scales at which GDELT can be used to understand our world.We can't wait to share with you what we've been working on.The Official GDELT Project Blog\""

              "'One of the many interesting themes of Google I/O 2024 was just how many attendees on the sidelines were predicting the end of RAG as Google announced early access to its 2M token Gemini model and again teased a 10M token version and the eventual availability of unlimited context windows. Perhaps most fascinating of all was the sheer number of attendees and startups I met who noted that their entire available corporate archives that they thought they might ever analyze with an AI model already fit comfortably within Gemini\\'s existing 1M token model. A constant theme was \"Who needs RAG in a world where everything fits natively in the context window?\" Yet, this reflects both a failure of imagination in how GenAI models will be applied in the future and just how massively data-intense GDELT\\'s vision of cataloging and understanding the planet truly is.While context windows continue to expand, there are a number of technical challenges and capability tradeoffs to ever-larger context windows. While today\\'s 1M token models like Gemini 1.5 Pro can indeed process a million tokens of input at once, we find that in practice their attention and reasoning capabilities have not scaled with their context windows, meaning that when pressed to their max window sizes, their performance tends to drop substantially. For example, RW-NIAH needle in a haystack tests on Gemini 1.5 Pro show extremely poor performance on real world content not found in its training data, demonstrating that for many tasks simply fitting all of the content in the context window is no substitute for prefiltering and reformatting for the model. In other words, even in cases where all data fits within the context window, RAG still offers powerful advantages in distilling down the input to just the most relevant entries to help the model focus.Until unlimited context windows become both widely available and robust, RAG will still be an absolute requirement for data-intensive applications like GDELT simply because the sheer volume of GDELT\\'s daily monitoring volume means no currently contemplated context window sizes would be sufficient to examine even a small fraction of GDELT\\'s monitoring. Critically, even limitless context windows will still require RAG-like solutions at GDELT scale, simply because even scaled attention cannot fit the entirety of all global reporting.Thus, far from dead, RAG will continue to play a crucial role in enabling GDELT scale classes of AI-powered analytics.The Official GDELT Project Blog'"
